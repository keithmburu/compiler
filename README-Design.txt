PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS PRELIMINARY VERISON OF THE FILE, TO AVOID GIT CONFLICTS LATER
 (if you're working before the update version is available, make a copy and edit that)

Important Design Decisions:

   *


Project Status (T = code completed and test suite exists, C = code completed, P = in-progress, N = not started):

   C  Parse + and* operations, constants and identifiers
   C  Build an Object-Oriented AST from the above
   C  Appropriately allocate registers for arithmetic operations
   C  Generate HERA code for +, *, and constants

 ---- more will be added later ----
